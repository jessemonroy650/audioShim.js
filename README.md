Two (2) simple audio libraries to assit with audio development. One acts as a shim that will work with a webbrowser and Phonegap's Media plugin.

## How it Works ##
`audioShim.js` is a wrapper for two APIs. The W3C API for audio and Cordova/Phonegap's API for Media. This is not a complete wrapper it is intended for Development ONLY. It is not intended for production.



## USAGE ##
Create your first draft of your phonegap App with the usual plug requirements.
